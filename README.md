# Project Overview
This is a project done as a part of Data Science and AI course at Becode in 2024.
The mission is to to execute exploratory data analysis and visualisation of a dataset, including information about at least 10.000 properties all over Belgium. 
Main steps of the project are:
1. Cleaning of the scrapped data (handaling duplicates, missing data and outliers)
2.  Data analysis and interpretation(examination of correlation and visulization of target variable with the most correlated ones)

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following:

1. Python 3.x installed.
2. pip for managing Python packages.
3. for the required libraries please refer to 
    requirements.txt --- install using the command pip install -r utils/requirements.txt


# Usage

This script will:
1. Load a dataset previously scrapped from Immoweb
2. Cleans it in regarding duplicates, missing data and outliers
3. Investigates correlation to indicate the most important influential variables
4. Visualize the result of EDA
5. The final output could be used for analysing the housing market in Belgium using ML
